# see-through (torch) — RETIRED

**Retired. The four component repositories are the line of work.** Nothing is deleted
and no measurement is retracted. Upstream is unaffected: this is our fork, and
`shitagaki-lab/see-through` continues.

## Where the models went

See-Through is four separately trained models, and this repository held all four. CLAUDE.md
says one standalone repo per model rather than one repo with many model folders, so each is
now forked from `shitagaki-lab/see-through` directly:

| model | repository |
| ----- | ---------- |
| LayerDiff 3D, transparent layer generation | `weftspun/interactor-seethrough-layerdiff` |
| Marigold Depth, anime pseudo-depth | `weftspun/interactor-seethrough-marigold-depth` |
| VAE | `weftspun/interactor-seethrough-vae` |
| SAM Body Parsing, 23 semantic parts | `weftspun/interactor-seethrough-partseg` |

## What retirement costs, stated rather than discovered later

Two things live here and in none of the four, so they go with this repository unless
somebody moves them:

**The end-to-end pipeline.** `inference/scripts/inference_psd.py` runs LayerDiff and
Marigold in sequence to a layered PSD. A pipeline that composes four models is not any one
of them, and splitting the models did not split it.

**The RunPod image build.** `.github/workflows/image.yml` builds a linux/amd64 image, added
here in three commits on top of upstream and serialised across branches. The component
forks inherit upstream's workflows, not ours.

Neither is a reason to keep the repository open — the decomposition was asked for and the
cost is the price of it — but a cost nobody wrote down is a cost somebody rediscovers.

## TL;DR

We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable **2.5D models**. Our approach decomposes a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders — up to **23 layers** including hair, face, eyes, clothing, accessories, and more.

### Online Demo

We have prepared [a Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/24yearsold/see-through-demo) with ZeroGPU, so that if you register with HuggingFace, you should be able to run 1-2 PSD extractions per day (approximately 2-3 mins each, at 1280 resolution).

For users in Mainland China, we also provide a [ModelScope demo](https://modelscope.cn/studios/ljsabc/See-Through). It's completely free now, and supports slightly higher resolution than the HuggingFace demo. We will continue to maintain both demos to ensure accessibility for users worldwide.

中国大陆用户可以使用[魔搭社区 ModelScope 在线演示](https://modelscope.cn/studios/ljsabc/See-Through)，目前完全免费，并且可以使用更高一点的分辨率。

## Usage

### Layer Decomposition (main pipeline)

`inference_psd.py` runs the full See-through pipeline: it applies the **LayerDiff 3D** model
for transparent layer generation and the fine-tuned **Marigold** model for pseudo-depth
inference, then stratifies the character into up to **23 semantic layers** and exports a
layered PSD file. Note that the separation for head and body are in two continuous stages, which
may lead to a longer time than the original model mentioned in the paper. 

```bash
# Decompose a single image into a layered PSD
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd

# Process a directory of images
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp path/to/image_folder/ \
  --save_to_psd
```

Output is saved to `workspace/layerdiff_output/` by default. Each result includes:
- A layered `.psd` file with semantically separated layers
- Intermediate depth maps and segmentation masks

> **Note:** This uses our most recent model with 23-layer body part separation (V3).


Once you have finished the layer splitting, you can further process the PSD with the scripts in `inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py` for depth-based or left-right stratification.


```bash
# Split based on depth
python inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py seg_wdepth --srcp workspace/test_samples_output/PV_0047_A0020.psd --target_tags handwear


#Left-right split
python inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py seg_wlr --srcp workspace/test_samples_output/PV_0047_A0020_wdepth.psd --target_tags handwear-1
```

### Low-VRAM Users

The default pipeline runs at bf16 precision and requires approximately 12-16 GB of VRAM at 1280 resolution.

**12 GB GPUs**: Enable group offload to reduce peak VRAM to ~10 GB at 1280 resolution:

```bash
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd \
  --group_offload
```

**8 GB GPUs**: Use the NF4 quantized pipeline, which uses 4-bit quantized model weights. This achieves ~8 GB peak VRAM at 1280 resolution, and can be further reduced by lowering the resolution with group offload:

```bash
# Install bitsandbytes (one-time)
pip install -r requirements-inference-bnb.txt

# Run with NF4 quantization (default: group_offload on, depth resolution 720)
python inference/scripts/inference_psd_quantized.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd

# For even lower VRAM, reduce layerdiff resolution to 1024
python inference/scripts/inference_psd_quantized.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd \
  --resolution 1024
```

The quantized models are hosted on HuggingFace and downloaded automatically on first run. Quality is close to the full-precision model (PSNR ~30 dB, SSIM ~0.96 vs bf16 baseline).

> **Note:** Group offload trades speed for VRAM savings (roughly 1.5x slower). NF4 quantization has minimal speed overhead but reduces model weight memory.

**8 GB GPUs**: Block swap pipeline achieves ~8 GB peak VRAM at 1280 resolution with bf16 precision:

```bash
python inference/scripts/inference_psd_blockswap.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd \
```

### Preparing the dataset for training (e.g., Live2D Parsing)

We have provided a separate repo for you to prepare the dataset for training the Live2D parsing model. Please refer to [CubismPartExtr](https://github.com/shitagaki-lab/CubismPartExtr) to know how to download the sample model files and prepare your workspace folder. 

After that, refer to the `README_datapipeline.md` for the instructions on how to run the data parsing scripts to prepare the dataset for inspection and training. 

### User Interface

Once you have prepared your data, you may go ahead with the user interfaces. Refer to [UI Readme](ui/README.md) for the instructions on how to launch the UI.

> We currently require the `workspace/datasets/` folder located at the repository root to launch the UI, as it contains the sample data for demonstration. We will work on making this more flexible in the future.

> We recommend installing the `mmdet` tier dependencies to ensure the UI can launch successfully. 


### Training

Training scripts for all models (LayerDiff, Marigold depth, VAE, body part segmentation)
are available in [`training/`](training/README.md), along with configs and data pipeline
utilities. Our training was conducted on 8x NVIDIA H200 GPUs.

## Discussion: Is this Image-to-Live2D?

We don't think so — at least, not yet.

While we produce 2.5D layer decompositions from a single image,
the full Image-to-Live2D pipeline requires significantly more:

1. **Finer artistic decomposition.** Live2D models demand layers designed with specific
   deformation behaviors in mind. Our automatic decomposition prioritizes semantic
   correctness, but a Live2D artist would make different artistic choices about how
   to split layers for natural-looking motion.

2. **Rigging.** After decomposition, a Live2D model needs a deformation mesh, physics
   parameters, and motion curves — this rigging process is arguably the most critical
   (and labor-intensive) step, and it is not covered in this project.

3. **Artistic intent.** Professional Live2D works are crafted holistically: the layer
   structure, inpainting style, and rigging are designed together. Automating one step
   in isolation cannot replicate this.

That said, we believe our decomposition can serve as a useful **starting point** for
Live2D artists by eliminating some of the most tedious part of the workflow, such as manual segmentation
and occluded region inpainting.

## Changelog

**2026-04-14**
- Released training scripts, configs, and data pipeline for all models (LayerDiff, Marigold depth, VAE, body part segmentation). This is the V3 model with 23 body-part tag training.

**2026-04-02**
- Multiple memory optimizations; added suggestions for low-VRAM users (group offload, NF4 quantization).
